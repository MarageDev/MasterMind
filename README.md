# MindMaster
## What is it ?
  This is a simple python code replicating the game Master Mind made by Mordecai Meirowitz in 1970. It's a 2 player game.
### How to play
  Once you've opened the code, run it with a terminal and follow the console logs, you need to be 2. Firstly, one player needs to enter a code of 4 digits ( if it isn't, it'll show a warning in the console ), then the 2nd player needs to enter test codes to see if it's the one entered by the 1st player. Below the test code, there's an hint log telling if the number entered are presents in the code entered by the 1st player to help the other to find the code.
### Features
  - Reworked Logs
  - An app to run it instead of runing it in the terminal and get a nicer UI
  - A 1 player mode where the target code will be random
  - Maybe letter support
  - Customization settings ( tries, code format... )
  - Reworked ReadMe on github with images and maybe videos ( And maybe add this project to a global github webpage with all my work )
## Credits
Marage and Mordecai Meirowitz for the original idea
